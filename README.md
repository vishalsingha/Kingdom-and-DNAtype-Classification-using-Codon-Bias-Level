# Kingdom-and-DNAtype-Classification-using-Codon-Bias-Level [[DEMO]](http://codonusage.herokuapp.com/)


## Problem Statement:
Given codon usage data, we can train machine learning models which could classify the organism into different classes of Kingdom and DNAtype, if the codon usage data is known.

## Dataset
The dataste is taken from UCI machine learning repository [LINK](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Codon+usage)

## Future Work :
* Deep learning models can also be tried for prediction.
* Custom models can be improved further to increase predictions.
* Some new features can be engineered.
* Instead of two different models for each task, we may also use a single model for the prediction of both DNA type and Kingdom.
